# Dungeon Dweller

An inverted roguelike (you play as the titular dweller of a dungeon, i.e. a monster) written in Flash with copious help from Flashpunk. Should be quite self-sufficient as long as you can compile AS3 already :)

More documentation later. Project under *very* slow and infrequent development.

# TODO

* Prioritize TODOs! Heh

* NPC room object detection. Basically, we need a way for NPCs to see what's near them and see if it's interesting. If so, engage pathfinding and grab!
* NPC object pickup.
* NPC stat modification by item. Use player calcs.
* NPC variation. No idea what that means at the moment - it'll be fun finding out!
* Player/friend swap code needed for tight quarters.
* Diagonal movement.
* Shift + direction goes through entire hallway.
* Apparently copper leather still exists.
* Add rest of items to XML.
* Consider using lastKey along with pressed(ANY) for figuring out what key was pressed?
* Time-based regen.
* *BIG BUG HERE*: Def numbers fluctuate with same gear. Also, just plain fluctuating.
