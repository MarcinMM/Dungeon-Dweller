# Dungeon Dweller

An inverted roguelike (you play as the titular dweller of a dungeon, i.e. a monster) written in Flash with copious help from Flashpunk. Should be quite self-sufficient as long as you can compile AS3 already :)

More documentation later. Project under *very* slow development.

# TODO

* Fix hallways.
* NPC pathing through existing corridors.
* Basic NPC behavior.
* Advanced NPC behavior! HAR.
